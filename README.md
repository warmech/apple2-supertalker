# Supertalker - A Speech Digitizer for the Apple II

The Supertalker is a speech digitizer card for the Apple II by Mountain Computer, Inc. Originally produced in 1979 (and subsequently for the PC in the 1980s), the Supertalker is capable of digitizing and playing back speech at any of four bitrates: 0.5 KBps, 1 KBps, 2 KBps, and 4 KBps. The kit originally included a microphone and enclosed (in woodgrain, no less) speaker for use with the card.

This card is somewhat hard to find now, but I happened to come across one at a recent retrocomputing meetup for a few bucks (not knowing what it was other than some cursory googling at the time) and wanted to preserve it. The included manual and disk images are care of [apple2.org](https://mirrors.apple2.org.za/Apple%20II%20Documentation%20Project/Interface%20Cards/Speech/Mountain%20Computer%20Supertalker/).

More details to follow once initial assembly and testing are completed.
